# NewLuggageDataset
Real-time abandoned luggage detection framework using enhanced YOLOv12 models and spatio-temporal reasoning. A custom-trained YOLOv12m improves small-object detection, while YOLOv12x ensures robust person tracking. Abandonment is determined through interpretable distance and time constraints for reliable public safety surveillance.
